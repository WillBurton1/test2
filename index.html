<p>I’m writing this down because I need to document it. I’m not sure why, but I have this nagging feeling that I might regret not recording it all—if not for myself, then for anyone who might come looking later.</p>

  <p>I found something today. I can’t explain it, not really. Not yet. It’s a cartridge. Old. Worn. I found it buried in the dirt while walking through the woods, a place I’ve been through countless times. There was nothing out of the ordinary about the walk itself, but when I knelt down and pulled the thing from the earth, something about it didn’t sit right.</p>

  <p>It wasn’t like finding an old game or tech relic. It looked like one of those things—like a cassette or some kind of cartridge—but it didn’t feel like one. The weight was off, and the surface wasn’t like any plastic I’ve ever touched. It was unnervingly smooth, too smooth. Like it had been molded or… something else. There were no markings, no logos, just a blank, dirty shell. Nothing that said where it came from or when it was made. Just nothing.</p>

  <p>I’ve heard the rumors. About the strange lights above the trees. About the sounds that don’t make sense. About people who disappear or come back wrong. I used to roll my eyes at it. This is a quiet little forest, isolated enough that people start to imagine things when they’re alone with their thoughts too long. But… now? I’m not so sure.</p>

  <p>The thing is, there’s more to it than just the cartridge. It’s the way I found it—half buried, like it was hidden. And the way it felt when I picked it up. Like it didn’t belong here. It didn’t belong in this world.</p>

  <p>I’m not one for superstition, but I’ve started to wonder. If this is connected to those stories, to those rumors, then what the hell have I found? A part of me wants to throw it away, leave it where I found it and never think about it again. But another part of me is too curious. What if it is something, something that could explain the weird things that have happened here over the years? Something that could… connect dots I didn’t even know existed?</p>

  <p>I’ve decided to test it. I don’t know why, but I’m going to plug it into an old console I have in the basement. I know that sounds insane. I don’t even know if it’s supposed to be used in a console, but I’ll figure that out when I get there. I don’t expect it to work the way I think it should. Hell, it might not work at all. But I can’t just leave it alone.</p>

  <p>I’m also going to upload this entry to my blog, but with a password. It’ll only be accessible to the people I trust—just in case. In case something happens. I’m not saying it will, but there’s this feeling in my gut that tells me I need to be careful. I don’t know what I’m about to mess with, and I’m not ready to let the whole world know about it yet.</p>

  <p>Maybe I’m overreacting. Maybe I’m letting my mind get carried away with things that don’t make sense. But I’ve spent too much time in these woods to ignore the weirdness. The lights in the sky, the odd noises, the people who talk about things they can’t explain. Maybe it’s all connected. Maybe it’s not.</p>

  <p>Either way, I need to know what this cartridge does.</p>
  <p>Sorry I havent updated this since February, its been a long month since.</p>
  <p>If I don’t post again soon, someone needs to come looking for me.</p>
